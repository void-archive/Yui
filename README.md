# Yui Hirasawa [![Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/382725233695522816/embed.png)](https://discord.gg/Bkh4F5W)
Yui Hirasawa is a multimodular discord bot made in the [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris) library

## Installation
Since Yui is tedious to install, I won't help nor the discord server will either. But, if you really do you will need to credit me since it's nessary or a request of takedown will be taken into action. | You must follow the `Apache 2.0` license's guidelines. Your Yui must be open source.

You will need:
```
    Node.js - The Bot's runtime enviroment
    Git - To clone the git repository
    RethinkDB - Our Database
    Some API keys:
        DiscordBotList API 
            This is optional, if the bot doesn't have it, it won't upload.
        DiscordBots API 
            This is optional, if the bot doesn't have it, it won't upload.
        BotList API
            This is optional.
        Terminal API
            This is optional.
        YouTube API
            The music category will not be enabled if the API key isn't set.
        osu! API 
            The osu! command will not be enabled if the API key isn't set
```
        
We do provide a Dockerfile but that installation process will be soon:tm:.

If you need other support (**NOT CLONING THE BOT**); You can go on our discord server!
